## üîÑ Next Steps Required

### Immediate Fixes Needed
1. **Fix Vue reactivity issues** - Participants page blank
2. **Remove all localStorage/mock data** from all components

4. **Implement proper error handling** across all views
5. **Add loading states** to all data operations

### Components Requiring Updates
